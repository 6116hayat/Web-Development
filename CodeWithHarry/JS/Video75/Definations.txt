Ques. What is CallBack function??
Ans.  A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked or "called back" at a later time after some operation is completed. This allows you to execute a function after the completion of another function.

In simple terms :-
→ A callback function is like giving someone a task to do after you finish your own task.

→ You tell one function to do something, and then you pass another function (the callback) to be done after the first one finishes.


Ques. What are promises?
Ans.  Promises in JavaScript are a way to handle asynchronous operations, making your code more manageable and readable. They represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. Promises are particularly useful for handling things like API calls, where you have to wait for a response from a server.

Here's a simple explanation:

Imagine you order a book online. The order is like making a promise.

At the moment you order, you don't have the book yet, but the promise is that you'll either get the book (resolved) or something will go wrong (rejected).
